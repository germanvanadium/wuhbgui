# WuhbGUI
WuhbGUI is a frontend for DevkitPro's wuhbtool!
## Dependencies
You will need devkitPro installed to use the program, later versions of this program will automatically ship with the newest version of wuhbtool, but for now you will need to get wuhbtool yourself. <br> <br>
If you want to build the program, you just need Java, no dependencies or external libraries are required!
## Features
I think the program is pretty self-explanatory, its a frontend that helps creating WUHB files!<br>
<br>
![Demonstration of the program](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/germanvanadium/wuhbgui/main/wuhbgui.png)<br>
You can also change the WUHBTOOL path in the settings menu!
## Roadmap
You can find a roadmap of what I am planning to add [here](https://trello.com/b/9E1lVdtV/wuhbtool)
A quick sumary of the important features that __probably__ are gonna come:<br><br>
• A automatic wuhbtool downloader from the official repo<br>
• Support for the /content/ Partion (there is no reason that this is not already in the program so its probably gonna get added on the first update after V1)<br>
• WUHB-Extractor (extract informations from a already existing WUHB file)<br>
• .wuhbconf (a file with informations for the program on what it needs to do, for automation purposes)<br><br>
## Alternatives
[This](https://github.com/NoahAbc12345/WUHB-Packager) is a alternative to wuhbgui, made by NoahAbc12345, it is made in Python and it should work aswell. Ive made this program to have my own version where I implement the features I need and if you feel more comfortable using his tool, then use it! :)
